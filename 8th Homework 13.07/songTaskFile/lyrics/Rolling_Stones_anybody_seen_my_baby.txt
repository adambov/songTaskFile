Anybody seen my baby by Rolling Stones

She confessed her love to me
Then she vanished on the breeze
Trying to hold on to that was just impossible
She was more than beautiful
Closer to ethereal
With a kind of down to earth flavor.

I Close my eyes.
It's three in the afternoon
Then I realize
That she's really gone for good.

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around

Love has gone and made me blind
I've looked but I just can't find
She has gotten lost in the crowd
And I was flippin' magazines
In that place on Mercer street
When I thought I spotted her
And getting on a motor bike
Looking really lady like

Didn't she just give me a wave?

Salty tears

It's three in the afternoon
Has she disappeared
Has she really gone for good

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around

If I just close my eyes
I reach out and touch the prize
Anybody seen her around
Oh yeah that's what I'm sayin'
We came to rock for Brooklyn
And Queens and Long Island
And all over the world

We came to rock for everybody like this
Anybody seen my baby (anybody, anybody seen my baby)
Anybody seen her, anybody seen her around

If I just close my eyes
I reach out, I reach out and touch the prize

Anybody seen her around
anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around (lost, lost and never found)
(Oh yeah) I must have called her a thousand times
Oh, sometimes I think she's just in my imagination
